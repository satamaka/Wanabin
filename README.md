# Wanabin
Building my own /bin tools, one by one.

A work in progress. It currently features `cat` and `echo`, with more tools are on the way.

## Build
Just run make:

```$ make```

## Contribution
I'm just playing around for now (apologies for the unrefined code 😅).

If you find bugs, please feel free to report them. However, please understand that I may not be able to fix them immediately. Contributions are highly welcome! If you can provide a fix, please submit a Pull Request.

Note: Please be respectful. Abusing or insulting others will not be tolerated.

## Philosophy
"Wannabe" + /bin.

I'm writing this step by step to understand how things work under the hood.

## Status
- [x] **cat**: Basic functionality implemented. Supports reading from files and standard input (stdin).

- [x] **echo**: Basic functionality implemented. Supports `-n` flag.

- [ ] **ls**: TBD

- [ ] **pwd**: TBD

- [ ] **mkdir**: TBD
