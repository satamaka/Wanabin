# Wanabin
Building /bin tools, one by one.

A collection of POSIX-style core utilities (cat, pwd, etc.) re-implemented in C language.

**Not yet fully compliant, but aiming for POSIX standards.**

## Build
Just run :

```$ make```

## Contribution
I'm just playing around for now (apologies for the unrefined code 😅).

If you find bugs, please feel free to report them. However, please understand that I may not be able to fix them immediately. Contributions are highly welcome! If you can provide a fix, please submit a Pull Request.

Note: Please be respectful. Abusing or insulting others will not be tolerated.

## Philosophy
"Wannabe" + /bin.

I'm writing this step by step to understand how things work under the hood.

## Status
Development progress is tracked in [src/README.md](src/README.md).
