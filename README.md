**Not yet fully compliant, but aiming for POSIX standards.**

## Build
To compile all utilities at once, simply run :

```$ make```

# Contribution
I'm building this project step-by-step to understand how things work under the hood! 🛠️
While the code is still unrefined (apologies for the mess 😅), I would love to have you involved!

## Philosophy
"Wannabe" + /bin.

I'm writing this step by step to understand how things work under the hood.

## Status
Development progress:
- **Total commands planned:** 10 / 164
- **POSIX-compliant commands:** 3 / 164
