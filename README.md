# Wanabin
Building my own /bin tools, one by one.

A work in progress. It currently only features 'cat', but more tools are on the way.

## Build
Just run make:

$ make

## Contribution
I'm just playing around for now. 

If you find bugs, you can tell me, but I might not fix them immediately.

**Note: Please be respectful. Abusing or insulting others will not be tolerated.**

## Philosophy
"Wannabe" + "/bin". 

I'm writing this step by step to understand how things work.

## Status
- [x] cat: Basic functionality implemented. Supports reading from files and standard input (stdin).
- [ ] echo: TBD
- [ ] ls: TBD
