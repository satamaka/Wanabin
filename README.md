# Wanabin
Building my own /bin tools, one by one.

A work in progress. It currently only features 'cat', but more tools are on the way.

## Build
Just run make:

$ 'make'

##Contribution
I'm just playing around for now. (Sorry for my dirty code.😢)

If you find bugs, please feel free to report them. However, I may not be able to fix them immediately. Contributions are welcome—if you have a fix, please submit a Pull Request!

Note: Please be respectful. Abusing or insulting others will not be tolerated.

##Philosophy
"Wannabe" + "/bin".

I'm writing this step by step to understand how things work under the hood.

##Status
[x] 'cat': Basic functionality implemented. Supports reading from files and standard input (stdin).

[ ] 'echo': TBD

[ ] 'ls': TBD
