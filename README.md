# Wanabin
A collection of POSIX-style core utilities (cat, pwd, etc.) re-implemented in C language.

**Not yet fully compliant, but aiming for POSIX standards.**

## Build
To compile all utilities at once, simply run :

```$ make```

## Contribution
I'm building this project step-by-step to understand how things work under the hood! 🛠️

## Philosophy
"Wannabe" + /bin.

I'm writing this step by step to understand how things work under the hood.

## Status
